HOSPITAL ER ASSIGNMENT - COMPLETE LEARNING PATH
Practice Questions: Q1 to Q10
Final Goal: Build Hospital Emergency Room Management System

---

## 🎯 OVERALL OBJECTIVE
Learn Queue, List, and PriorityQueue operations step-by-step to build a
complete Hospital ER Management System with priority-based patient handling.

## 📚 LEARNING ROADMAP

### SECTION 1: QUEUE BASICS (Q1-Q3)
Building foundation for queue operations

✅ Q1: NumberQueue - Simple Queue Operations
   - Topics: offer(), poll(), peek(), isEmpty()
   - Data: Integer values
   - Status: COMPLETED

✅ Q2: TaskQueue - Queue with Custom Objects
   - Topics: Custom class, toString(), object queues
   - Data: Task objects
   - Status: COMPLETED

📋 Q3: EmptyQueueHandling - Robust Error Handling
   - Topics: null checking, try-catch, element() vs peek()
   - Data: Process queue with validation
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: Exception handling, safe queue operations


### SECTION 2: LIST OPERATIONS (Q4-Q5)
Learning ArrayList operations for data storage

📋 Q4: StudentList - Basic List Operations
   - Topics: add(), get(), remove(), size(), indexOf()
   - Data: String names
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: Index-based access, searching, removal

📋 Q5: BookLibrary - List with Custom Objects
   - Topics: Custom objects in ArrayList, searching by ID
   - Data: Book objects with multiple fields
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: Object searching, complex data handling


### SECTION 3: QUEUE + LIST INTEGRATION (Q6-Q7)
Combining both data structures

📋 Q6: OrderManagementSystem - Dual Structure
   - Topics: Queue for pending, List for completed
   - Data: Order objects
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: Data flow between structures, state management

📋 Q7: MovieTicketBooking - Advanced Integration
   - Topics: Queue + List + specific element removal
   - Data: Customer objects
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: Cancellation logic, name-based search


### SECTION 4: PRIORITY QUEUE (Q8-Q9)
Understanding automatic sorting and comparators

📋 Q8: PriorityNumbers - Simple Priority
   - Topics: PriorityQueue basics, natural ordering
   - Data: Integer values
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: How PriorityQueue automatically sorts

📋 Q9: PersonAgeQueue - Custom Comparator
   - Topics: Lambda expressions, custom sorting logic
   - Data: Person objects with age
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: Comparator creation, age-based priority


### SECTION 5: FINAL INTEGRATION (Q10)
Putting everything together

📋 Q10: MiniHospital - Complete System Preview
   - Topics: All concepts combined
   - Data: Patient objects with emergency levels
   - Status: PENDING
   - Will Learn: Full system integration, priority + history

## 🎓 CONCEPTS COVERED (Q1-Q10)

### Queue Operations:
- offer() - Safe adding
- poll() - Safe removal with null return
- peek() - View without removal
- element() - View with exception
- remove() - Remove with exception
- isEmpty() - Empty check
- size() - Count elements

### List Operations:
- add() - Adding elements
- get(index) - Access by position
- remove(index) - Remove by position
- indexOf(element) - Find position
- contains(element) - Check existence
- size() - Count elements
- isEmpty() - Empty check

### PriorityQueue:
- Natural ordering (Comparable)
- Custom ordering (Comparator)
- Lambda expressions
- Integer.compare() usage

### Object-Oriented Programming:
- Encapsulation (private variables)
- Constructors
- Getters/Setters
- toString() override
- Custom class design

### Best Practices:
- Null checking
- Return statements
- Exception handling
- Code formatting
- Descriptive naming
- Documentation
